 INCUBED (in3) is a minimal verification client for blockchain networks, this version of the in3 node is written
 in typescript. The in3-node provides the data and proof used by the client for verification.
 
 The in3-node mainly provides data from the Ethereum clients to the in3-clients. The in3-node can act as a regular RPC-provider,
  but in3-nodes also have the ability to provide [merkle-proofs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getproof) 
  with signed blockhashes in their responses. The merkle-proofs can be used by the clients to make sure that the 
  [response was correct](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/develop/poa.html). The signed blockHeader in the response acts as 
  a extra layer of security, in case the in3-node was found to have provided a blockHeader that is not part of the chain,
  their deposit can be taken away.
  Using this technique an in3-client has an insurance that it will receive a valid response, allowing it to query
  nodes that it might not be affiliated with.

  A more detailed explanation of in3 can be found [here](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/develop/intro.html).

 ## Installation and Usage
 
 Please only run an in3-node if you have some experience with networking and private key management. It is not expected
 for regular users to run their own in3-node, you may always use public in3-nodes. A list of public nodes for use by 
 anyone can be found [here](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/develop/getting_started.html#supported-chains).

 | in3-node (ts)      | Docker Hub | [![DockerHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/DockerHub-image-blue)](https://hub.docker.com/r/slockit/in3-node)| To run the in3-node, which the in3-client can use to connect to the in3 network |

 ### Docker Hub
1. Pull the image from docker using ```docker pull slockit/in3-node```
2. In order to run your own in3-node, you must first register the node. The information for registering a node can be found 
[here](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/develop/getting_started.html#registering-an-incubed-node)
3. Run the in3-node image using a direct docker command or a docker-compose file, the parameters for which are explained 
[here](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/develop/api-node-server.html)

 ## Example 
 ### POST Request
  
  Once the in3-node has been registered in the in3 network, and the in3-node port has been exposed, you can test the in3-node
  with the following POST request to the IP/URL configured to your in3-node:
  ```
{
  "id": 1, 
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber", 
  "params": ["latest",true], 
	"in3": {
		"chainid": "0x5",
		"verification": "proof"
	}	
}
```
  This JSON rpc request should return the the latest block of the chain specified in "chainid". The POST request mentioned above 
  is configured for the Görli test chain.
